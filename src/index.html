</head><h1>Old-Fashioned Blackberry Cobbler</h1>
<body><h2> That tastes like home.</h2>
</body><h3>If you're looking for an old-fashioned "do not stir" style of blackberry cobbler, you've come to the right place. The batter magically rises through the blackberry mixture to become the topping, with crispy, chewy, buttery edges. The no-stirring instructions are important to ensure the butter moves to the outer edges for a perfectly baked crust.</h3>
