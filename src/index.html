</body><h1>If you're looking for an old-fashioned "do not stir" style of blackberry cobbler, you've come to the right place. The batter magically rises through the blackberry mixture to become the topping, with crispy, chewy, buttery edges. The no-stirring instructions are important to ensure the butter moves to the outer edges for a perfectly baked crust.
</h1>Ingredients<h1>
</html>
1/2 cup (1 stick) salted butter, cut into 8 pieces
5 cups fresh blackberries
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, divided
1/2 tsp. table salt, divided
1 cup all-purpose flour (about 4 1/4 oz.)
2 tsp. baking powder
1 cup whole milk
1 tsp. vanilla extract
Vanilla ice cream (for serving) </h1>

</h1>Prepare the oven and dish:
Preheat oven to 375°F. 
Place butter in a 13 x 9 inch baking dish and set it in the oven as it heats.
Make the blackberry mixture: 
While the oven heats, toss blackberries with 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Let stand for 10 minutes.
Prepare the batter:
 Whisk together flour, remaining 1 cup sugar, baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Add milk and vanilla, and whisk until smooth.
Assemble the cobbler Carefully remove the baking dish from the oven once the butter is melted. Pour the batter evenly over the butter. Do not stir. Scatter the blackberry mixture (including any juices) over the batter.
Bake the cobbler Bake at 375°F for 40-45 minutes until the topping is golden brown and the fruit mixture is bubbly. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.</h1>
